    Prior to founding GaP, Matt and Bret built Environmental Transportation Businesses from the ground up. They also 
    acquired businesses to grow their footprint, add geographies, and extend the reach of those companies. Eventually, 
    they made the decision to sell those businesses and each was sold to Private Equity Buyers, Competitors, and Public 
    Companies.

  <p>
    Having once walked in&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOUR</mark>&thinsp;shoes they know the challenges of marketing 
    and successfully selling businesses in your industry. The first-hand, real-world experience Matt and Bret have with 
    the unique aspects of operating a privately-held or family-owned transportation and logistics operation means this 
    firm is uniquely qualified to understand and represent a transportation/logistics business 
    like&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOURS</mark>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    At GaP, our mission is to provide better representation consistently leading to better results. Our in-house 
    Accounting, Analytics, Finance, and Marketing teams are all manned by prior business owners and seasoned executives 
    who understand the intricacies of selling a business. Our client-to-advisor ratio is among the lowest in the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, all of this translates into&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOU</mark>&thinsp;getting the absolute best 
    representation in the business.
